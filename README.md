# Binary Brains - Code Translation and Conversion Tool

## Project Overview

The "Binary Brains" project aims to develop a code translation and conversion tool capable of translating code snippets between various programming languages. This tool will utilize GPT-3 to assist in the translation process, ensuring the accuracy and correctness of the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to facilitate the RedwoodJS framework, providing a full-stack development environment:

- `/api`: Backend logic, including integration with GPT-3 and database management.
- `/web`: Frontend code, consisting of user interface components built with React.

Additional directories may be added to support the specific needs of our project, such as:

- `/scripts`: Utility scripts for development and deployment.
- `/tests`: Testing scripts and test cases.

## Development Sprints

- **Sprint 1**: Project Initialization and UI Design
  - Initialize the RedwoodJS project structure.
  - Begin designing the user interface.

- **Sprint 2**: GPT-3 Integration and Initial Code Translation Logic
  - Integrate GPT-3 API.
  - Develop the initial logic for translating code between languages.

- **Sprint 3**: Code Translation Logic and Frontend Development
  - Refine the code translation logic.
  - Continue development of the frontend interface.

- **Sprint 4**: Testing, Documentation, and Final Refinement
  - Write and execute test cases.
  - Document the code and usage instructions.
  - Finalize UI and logic refinements.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Contributions are managed through Jira issues and discussed in our regular team meetings.
- All merge requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the main branch.
