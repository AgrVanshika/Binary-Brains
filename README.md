# Code Translation and Conversion Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the Code Translation and Conversion Tool, which is designed to convert code between different programming languages. The tool uses GPT-3 to assist in the translation process, ensuring the correctness of the translated code.

## Repository Structure

Our repository is organized into several main directories:

- `/src`: The heart of our application, containing all the executable code.
  - `/core`: Core logic for code translation, including the algorithms and models that drive the translation process.
  - `/gpt3`: Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 for code translation assistance and validation.
  - `/ui`: The user interface of the tool, built with React for a responsive web application.
  - `/utils`: Utility functions that provide general support for the application logic.

- `/docs`: Documentation of the project, including setup guides, user manuals, and API documentation.

- `/tests`: Automated tests to ensure the application's integrity and correctness, including unit tests and integration tests.

## Setup and Local Development

To set up the tool for local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.
3. Set up the necessary environment variables, including the GPT-3 API key.
4. Run the application locally with `npm start`.

For detailed instructions, refer to the setup guide in `/docs/setup.md`.
